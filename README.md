This was one of the very first projects I created in order to apply some of knowledge from the early courses I enrolled in at UCSD in order to create something tangible. It was a great starting point that allowed me to grasp the value of self-education and being proactive. The bare bone application was created in Java utilizing data structures, GUI, CSV files, and URLConnection to connect the program and a URL resource on the internet.
## Relevant Courses
Data Structures and Object Oriented Design, Software Tools and Techniques Lab, Discrete Mathematics, Calculus and Analytic Geometry for Science and Engineering, Computer Organization and Systems Programming.
