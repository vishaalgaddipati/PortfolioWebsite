This was one of the very first projects I created in order to apply some of knowledge from the early courses I enrolled in at UCSD in order to create something tangible. It was a great starting point that allowed me to grasp the value of self-education and being proactive. The bare bone application was created in Java utilizing data structures, GUI, CSV files, and URLConnection to connect the program and a URL resource on the internet.

### Linear Regression
This is a report revolving around utilizing data science in practice to discover if there is a correlation between weather and division 1 college basketball players. Linear regression was used following the analysis of data to rationalize the hypothesis, which can be found in the Jupyter notebook housing the report [here](https://github.com/vishaalgaddipati/LinearRegression/blob/main/FinalProject_group69.ipynb). Here are some data visualizations from the project:
