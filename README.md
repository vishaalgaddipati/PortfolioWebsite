This was one of the very first projects I created in order to apply some of knowledge from the early courses I enrolled in at UCSD in order to create something tangible. It was a great starting point that allowed me to grasp the value of self-education and being proactive. The bare bone application was created in Java utilizing data structures, GUI, CSV files, and URLConnection to connect the program and a URL resource on the internet.

### Developer Journal
This developer journal is a CRUD application built in a software team of 11 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following Agile methodologies. The project consisted of several sprint and retrospectives with advisor check ins and daily standups. The research, design, implemenation, testing, and maintenance took place over a period of 10 weeks. The public repository with all documentation and information can be found [here](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group5/cse110-sp24-group5). The link to our webapp is [https://cse110-sp24-group5.github.io/cse110-sp24-group5/source/html/index.html](https://cse110-sp24-group5.github.io/cse110-sp24-group5/source/html/index.html). Here are some features of our local-first application:<br>

My personal contributions to the project were:
- HTML, CSS, and JS for one of the main website features â€“ calendar with
dynamically generated days
- JS for keyboard shortcuts feature - in particular the calendar specific commands to
navigate the days or months and years
- Creating team wiki page with Markdown
- Setup the Figma and worked on the dashboard, icons, fonts, and color scheme for
the app
- Helped design our hand-drawn wireframes for desktop and mobile
- Helped revise pitch, cut down feature list, and redesign journal to be more
dev-specific
- Refactored JS code and added unit tests
- Worked on meeting notes, ADRs, and PR reviews
- Worked on brainstorming via Miro: user stories, feature list, and inspirations

### Linear Regression
This is a report revolving around utilizing data science in practice to discover if there is a correlation between weather and division 1 college basketball players. Linear regression was used following the analysis of data to rationalize the hypothesis, which can be found in the Jupyter notebook housing the report [here](https://github.com/vishaalgaddipati/LinearRegression/blob/main/FinalProject_group69.ipynb). Here are some data visualizations from the project:
