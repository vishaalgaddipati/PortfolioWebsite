This was one of the very first projects I created in order to apply some of knowledge from the early courses I enrolled in at UCSD in order to create something tangible.

The bare bone application was created in Java utilizing data structures, GUI, CSV files, and URLConnection to connect the program and a URL resource on the internet.
